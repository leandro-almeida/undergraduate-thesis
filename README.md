This is the final source code of my undergradute thesis, presented in December, 2007, at Federal University of Pará State, PA - Brazil (Universidade Federal do Pará)

The VIWebEJB + VIWebEar are just a prototype of future works, not finished.

Here are some screenshots of the application prototype:

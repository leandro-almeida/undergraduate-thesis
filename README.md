# VIWeb Application Prototype - My Undergraduate Thesis implementation
This is the final source code of my undergradute thesis, presented in December, 2007, at Federal University of Pará State, PA - Brazil (Universidade Federal do Pará)

* Abstract:
Due to the vast amount of data stored electronically, Information
Visualization (IV) techniques have been increasingly used to allow easy interaction
and rapid visual perception of data relationships by the user to find new
informations and help in decision-making and strategies. Among the various IV
techniques, this work uses the scatterplot technique, which is a technique that
organizes the data into visual representations based in XY axes. The development
platform is web-based, because the application can run in several different
machines with few software requirements, allowing the user to be geographically
distant, and following a global trend in the area. The tool was developed by
standard Web technologies (Java, JavaScript, Ajax, HTML Canvas), as an flexible
architecture enough to implement new IV techniques quickly and efficiently, and
followed the main requirements for a good IV software.

The important project files is in the VIWeb folder, where contains all javascripts, css and html files that actually makes the fun part of Data Visualization.
The VIWebEJB + VIWebEar are just a prototype of future works, not finished.

Here are some screenshots of the application prototype:
